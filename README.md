The R code to perform the analysis in this paper is found in analysis-IPM.R, with additional functions sourced from R/functions.R. R version 3.3.2 was used, and an R project file (SydHarbourCoral.Rproj) is included that was created in RStudio 1.0.143.  The figures that are produced by this code and included in the paper are in figs/.

Data files which are read in by analysis-IPM.R are in data/.  There are six data files, named as follows, whose contents are described in the paper:

(a) growth-Dec2011-Aug2012.txt
(b) growth-Dec2012-Dec2013.txt
(c) sex-size-Madsenetal2014.txt
